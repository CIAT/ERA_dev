## ERA Website Strategy Draft

### 1. Strategic Purpose of the Website

The ERA website will serve as a **modular hub** to both:

-   Present the **ERA vision, approach, and credibility** to external collaborators, donors, and institutions.
-   Provide a structured and user-friendly point of access to ERA’s technical content, including harmonized datasets, markdown documentation, and interactive tools.

It will improve visibility, unify scattered documentation, and provide a foundation to support further scaling, engagement, and adaptation of ERA’s data system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Target Audience and User Needs

The website will serve diverse but overlapping user groups:

| Audience | Needs |
|----|----|
| **Researchers & Data Scientists** | Access harmonized agronomy/livestock datasets, methodological guidance, use case documentation |
| **Donors & Program Officers** | Understand ERA’s scope, partners, scientific credibility, and applied impact |
| **AI/Tech Partners** | Integrate structured ERA data into pipelines or GPT-RAG frameworks (e.g., AgStack) |
| **Internal Collaborators** | Consistent reference for methods, vocabularies, and versioned outputs |

*Please suggest additional user types or specific needs based on your experience interacting with ERA stakeholders.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Core Components and Content to Include

The following sections are proposed:

-   **Homepage** – Intro to ERA’s mission, current scope, and global relevance (noting current African data focus)
-   **About ERA** – Vision, methodology, team, contact, acknowledgments
-   **Use Cases** – Short, structured stories documenting how ERA was applied in real projects (*see Use Case Template below*)
-   **Documentation** – Guides, vignettes, and data access instructions (sourced from ERA Agronomy/Livestock GitHub repos)
-   **Data & Tools Access** – Links to harmonized datasets, climate/soils enrichment, and GitHub repositories
-   **Interactive Tools** – Shiny app embeds (legacy and future), plus possible new visual interfaces
-   **Updates** – (Optional) newsfeed for new features, data releases, or publications

*Team input needed: Please identify any additional sections or critical markdowns/tools you believe must be included in Phase 1.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Technical Stack and Platform Recommendations

We recommend a **GitHub-based static site built with Quarto**, complemented by optional Shiny module embedding.

| Component | Recommended Option | Notes |
|----|----|----|
| **Site Generator** | [Quarto](https://quarto.org) | Markdown-based, supports code rendering, navigation, Shiny embedding |
| **Hosting** | GitHub Pages | Free, version-controlled, integrates with Quarto |
| **Interactivity** | Shiny apps hosted via Montpellier server (TBC with Brayden) | Minimal lift for legacy modules |
| **Design** | Clean, lightweight theme using existing ERA branding | Will explore CGIAR visual alignment as feasible |
| **Search** | Not prioritized unless native to theme | Navigation-first approach preferred for now |

**Pros:**

-   Minimal maintenance; suitable for a busy research team
-   Leverages existing markdowns and code
-   Open source and fully version controlled
-   Easy to extend later

**Cons:**

-   Limited WYSIWYG or non-code editing (some markdown/git knowledge needed)
-   Requires hosting Shiny apps separately
-   Visual customization limited unless CSS is added

*A short list of well-executed example sites will be shared for reference.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. Use Case Contributions and Templates

Use cases are a key way to demonstrate ERA’s applied value.

We propose a simple **YAML-based template** for team members and collaborators to complete:

``` yaml
title: Crop Model Calibration in Kenya
who: AgStack, Linux Foundation
user_type: AI/Data Integration
problem: Needed harmonized yield/fertilizer data for GPT-RAG integration
what_ERA_provided: Structured dataset on maize yield trials, NPK inputs, and climate
outcome: Used to validate advisory logic for an open-source agronomic assistant
quote: "ERA data allowed us to reduce reliance on scraped, unverified sources."
```

*We will circulate this template along with a request to complete 1–2 use cases each. If you’ve worked with a user, even informally, please suggest a relevant case.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. Interactivity and Tool Integration

Existing Shiny apps (e.g., ERA CKS) can be lightly updated and embedded.

*We need team input to identify:*

-   Which tools/apps are **high-value and feasible** to revive
-   Any gaps where new tools could **transform existing vignettes into interactive elements**
    -   What could be made more **accessible to non-programmers** (e.g., dropdowns instead of R code)

*If you’ve built or used a tool you think should be included, please flag it, even if it’s currently in draft or internal form.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7. Governance, Review, and Maintenance

-   **Content ownership** will be distributed by domain (e.g., agronomy, livestock, climate).
-   A small group (e.g., Peter, Brayden, Namita) will coordinate structure and integration.
-   No full-time developer is needed; markdown contributors plus 1 GitHub maintainer will suffice.
-   ERAg package maintenance will be considered a **Phase 2** priority after the website is established.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8. Immediate Next Steps

| Task | Owner | Notes |
|----|----|----|
| Draft content audit & markdown inventory request | [Consultant] | Includes prompt for core documents and tool priorities |
| Confirm Shiny hosting options with Brayden | [TBD] | Clarify if Montpellier server supports public hosting |
| Circulate use case template | [Peter?] | Collect initial 3–5 examples from team + partners |
| Review visual identity guidelines | [TBD] | Try to locate internal design resource, fallback to ERA branding |
| Prototype homepage & structure | [Consultant] | Using Quarto and GitHub Pages |
| Team feedback loop | Everyone | Input on site structure, content priorities, examples |
