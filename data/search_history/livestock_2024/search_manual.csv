"Comparative Study of Intake, Apparent Digestibility and Energy and Nitrogen Uses in Sahelian and Majorera Dairy Goats Fed Hay of Vigna unguiculata",https://doi.org/10.3390/ani10050861,,, metabolism; digestibility; energy; nitrogen; breed; goat; Vigna unguiculata; variety 58/74,"This study aimed to compare digestive and metabolic characteristics in Sahelian (S) and Majorera (M) goat breeds. Six lactating females from each breed, with an average weight 27.0 ± 1.93 and 23.7 ± 1.27 kg, respectively, were used. Cowpea hay, variety 58/74, was offered as sole feed ingredient, at a rate of 2 kg of fresh matter per animal per day. The animals were placed in metabolic cages and a digestibility test was conducted according to an adaptation period of 15 days and a collection period of 7 days. The daily chemical components offered and refused and recovered faeces, urine and milk were measured in order to assess energy and nitrogen utilization. The M and S goats had similar levels of dry matter (DM) intake as well as nutrient digestibility. On a metabolic weight basis, dry matter intake, gross energy intake, metabolizable and energy intake, digestible energy and energy lost as methane production were significantly higher (p < 0.01) in M than in S goats. Urinary energy excretion was similar (p = 0.9) between breeds, while faecal energy output was higher in M than in S goats. The milk energy output from the M goats was higher than that the S goats (p < 0.05). However, metabolizable to net energy conversion efficiency (klm) was not affected by breed (p = 0.37), while N intake, milk N yield and faecal N losses, relative to metabolic weight, were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in M than in S goats. Similarly, the percentage of dietary N intake excreted in urine (UNIN) was higher in S than in M breeds. The breed factor had no effect on N retained, N digestibility, urinary N and N use efficiency. In conclusion, the M and S goats were similar in terms of energy and nitrogen use efficiency, despite higher daily milk production and DM consumption in the M goat. This suggests that the M breed is possibly more dependent on a dense nutrition diet than the S breed but requires less maintenance nitrogen.",
Development of feeding systems and strategies of supplementation to enhance rumen fermentation and ruminant production in the tropics,https://doi.org/10.1186/2049-1891-4-32,,,Feed resources;Feeding system;Methane;Plant secondary compounds;Ruminants,"The availability of local feed resources in various seasons can contribute as essential sources of carbohydrate and protein which significantly impact rumen fermentation and the subsequent productivity of the ruminant. Recent developments, based on enriching protein in cassava chips, have yielded yeast fermented cassava chip protein (YEFECAP) providing up to 47.5% crude protein (CP), which can be used to replace soybean meal. The use of fodder trees has been developed through the process of pelleting; Leucaena leucocephala leaf pellets (LLP), mulberry leaf pellets (MUP) and mangosteen peel and/or garlic pellets, can be used as good sources of protein to supplement ruminant feeding. Apart from producing volatile fatty acids and microbial proteins, greenhouse gases such as methane are also produced in the rumen. Several methods have been used to reduce rumen methane. However, among many approaches, nutritional manipulation using feed formulation and feeding management, especially the use of plant extracts or plants containing secondary compounds (condensed tannins and saponins) and plant oils, has been reported. This approach could help todecrease rumen protozoa and methanogens and thus mitigate the production of methane. At present, more research concerning this burning issue - the role of livestock in global warming - warrants undertaking further research with regard to economic viability and practical feasibility.",
Dry Matter Intake and Milk Yield of Lactating West African Dwarf Ewes Fed RES-Based Diets,https://doi.org/10.24940/theijst/2020/v8/i3/ST1912-006,,,"Rumen epithelial scrapings, groundnut cake, replacement, diet, lactation","Twelve WAD ewes weighing 18.50±4.00kg were blocked by weight into three groups of four animals each in a randomized complete block design. They were kept in individual pens and fed formulated diets as supplement to a basal grass (Panicum maximum), together with fresh water ad-libitum daily. All experimental ewes were given prostaglandin F2Î± for synchronization of oestrus and served with herd ram as soon as signs of heat were detected. Milk samples were collected on days 1 – 5 (colostrums) and from week 2 to week 13. Milk samples were collected and stored without preservative in a freezing cabinet until required for analyses. Parameters measured and recorded were: Dry matter intake, Intake performance, Weight changes, Milk yield, Estimated weekly yield and milk yield per stage of lactation.

Treatment effects on DMI (g/BWkg0.75/day) in late lactation (88.77, 90.58 and 99.10 for ewes on treatment A, B and C respectively) were significant (p<0.05). Mean milk yield (kg) for the entire lactation period of 13 weeks (29.60±1.70, 34.50±4.70 and 41.60±10.90 for ewes on treatment A, B and C respectively) did not show a significant treatment effect. Colostrums were characterized by higher values in their contents of milk protein, energy and butter fat than mature milk. There were positive correlations (p<0.05) between total solids with milk energy (r=0.82, 0.95 and 0.88 for diets A, B and C respectively) and milk proteins with butterfat (r=0.44, 0.67 and 0.63 for diets A, B and C respectively) for ewes fed all diets.Variations observed for the efficiency of energy utilization for milk production (%) (20.88±0.46, 19.01±1.92 and 23.51±4.98) and efficiency of protein utilization for milk production (%) (17.48±0.27, 17.77±2.08 and 19.82±4.70) for animals on treatments A, B and C, were not significant.

RES incorporation in the diets of sheep supported pregnancy and lactation without any obvious adverse effect. Therefore, RES could suitably replace such expensive conventional feedstuff like GNC in the diets of WAd sheep and its use as livestock feedstuff will reduce health hazard and stench associated with it as an environmental pollutant.",
"Effect of dietary nitrate on enteric methane emissions, production performance and rumen fermentation of dairy cows grazing kikuyu-dominant pasture during summer",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2018.08.005,,,Electron receptor;Kikuyu;Methane mitigation;SF6,"Dietary nitrate supplementation is an effective methane (CH4) mitigation strategy in total mixed ration based diets fed to ruminants. To date, limited information is available on the effect of dietary nitrate on CH4 production from grazing dairy cows. Fifty-four multiparous Jersey cows were subjected to a randomised complete block design (blocked according to milk yield, days in milk and parity) to evaluate the effect of three dietary nitrate levels on enteric CH4 emissions and cow production performance. Additionally, six rumen-cannulated cows in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design were used in a rumen study. Dietary treatments consisted of concentrate fed at 5.4 kg of DM/cow per day containing one of three levels of dietary nitrate: 0 g (control), 11 g (low nitrate), and 23 g of nitrate/kg of dry matter (DM; high nitrate). Cows grazed late-summer pasture containing approximately 3 g of nitrate/kg of DM. Concentrates were formulated to be isonitrogenous, by substituting urea, and isoenergetic. Cows were gradually adapted to concentrates over a 3-wk period before the onset of a 57-d experimental period. Enteric CH4 emissions and total dry matter intake (DMI) from 11 cows per treatment were measured during one 6-d measurement period using the sulphur hexafluoride tracer gas technique. Individual pasture DMI was determined using TiO2 and indigestible neutral detergent fibre (NDF). Milk yield decreased by approximately 12% when feeding the high nitrate diet compared with the control and low nitrate diets. Although total DMI was unaffected by treatment, concentrate DMI decreased linearly (5.5–3.7 kg/d) while pasture DMI increased linearly (9.1–11.4 kg/d) with increasing dietary nitrate addition. Methane production (313–280 g/d), CH4 yield (21.8–18.7 g/kg of DMI) and CH4 energy per gross energy intake (6.9–5.9%) tended to decrease linearly with increasing dietary nitrate addition. Diurnal ruminal pH of the high nitrate group was greater, for selective periods after concentrate feeding, than the control and low nitrate groups. Spot sample ruminal pH (6.2–6.3) tended to increase while total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration (99.9–104 mM/L) increased quadratically with increasing dietary nitrate addition. Individual VFA concentrations were unaffected by treatment. Rate of NDF disappearance (2.4–2.8%/h) after 18 h of ruminal incubation tended to increase quadratically with increasing dietary nitrate addition. Dietary nitrate fed to grazing dairy cows tended to decrease CH4 emissions while improving the fibrolytic environment of the rumen. However, when feeding high levels of dietary nitrate a decrease in milk yield could be expected due to a decrease in concentrate DMI.

"Effect of dried Sesbania sesban leaves supplementation on milk yield, feed intake, and digestibility of Holstein Friesian X Zebu (Arado) crossbred dairy cows",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-018-1779-0 ,,,Digestibility;Milk yield;Nutrient intake;Sesbania sesban,"This experiment was conducted to investigate effect of dried Sesbania sesban leaves supplementation on milk yield, feed intake and digestibility of Holstein Frisian X Zebu (Arado) crossbred dairy cows. Twelve cows at midlactation (155.83 ± 4.49 days of lactation), second parity, and 442.21 ± 3.40 kg average live body weight were randomly assigned to one of four dietary treatments according to a randomized complete block design. Cows were blocked according to their daily milk yield into three blocks of four animals each. Cows were fed a basal diet (control) or a basal diet supplemented with 1.25 kg/day dried Sesbania sesban leaves, 2 kg/day dried Sesbania sesban leaves and 2.75 kg/day dried Sesbania sesban leaves on a dry matter basis for 8 weeks. Total dry matter intake, nutrient intake, milk yield, dry matter digestibility, and nutrient digestibility showed significant variation among treatments. Cows supplemented with the highest level of Sesbania sesban (2.75 kg/day) had higher total dry matter and nutrient intake. Similarly, cows supplemented with 2 and 2.75 kg/day had higher milk yield than the nonsupplemented cows (up to 11.3 and 16.2%, respectively). Digestibility was lower for the nonsupplemented cows compared to cows supplemented with 2 and 2.75 kg/day dried Sesbania sesban leaves but statistically similar to the cows supplemented with 1.25 kg/day dried Sesbania sesban leaves. Supplementation with 2.75 kg/day Sesbania sesban resulted in higher organic matter digestibility (OMD) compared to the control. Crude protein digestibility (CPD), neutral detergent fiber digestibility (NDFD), and acid detergent fiber digestibility (ADFD) were significantly affected by Sesbania sesban supplementation. The nonsupplemented cows had lower CPD, NDFD, and ADFD. These results indicate that dried Sesbania sesban leaves supplementation to dairy increases total DM intake, digestibility, and milk yield.",
Effect of pelleting crop residues on feed intake and digestibility in Djallonke sheep in North-sudanian zone of Burkina Faso,https://doi.org/10.30574/gscarr.2023.16.3.0353,,,Crop residues; Dual purpose sorghum; Dual purpose cowpea; Pellets; Sheep,"The effect of pelleting fodder on voluntary feed intake and digestibility in sheep was tested with sorghum straw and cowpea haulm in two forms (chopped and granulated). Twenty-four (24) sheep, of 18 to 24 months old, Djallonké breed were divided into 4 groups of 6 sheep following a random complete block device with four (04) treatments as follows: R1= 50% chopped sorghum straw + 50% chopped cowpea haulms, R2 = Granulated feed 1 (50% sorghum straw + 50% cowpea haulms), R3 = 50% chopped sorghum straw + 50% maize bran and R4 = Granulated feed 2 (50% chopped sorghum straw + 50% maize bran). Six (6) sheep per group underwent the intake trial, then consecutively five (5) sheep per group were retained and housed in digestibility cages for the digestibility test.
The voluntary intake of dry matter varied from 417.5 g/d for ration 3 to 600.5 g/d for ration 2. In terms of nutrient intake, ration 1 (75. 26g) records the highest intake of crude protein, followed by ration 2 (70.15g). There is no difference in voluntary intake within rations with forage chopped (R1 and R3) and pellet rations (R2 and R4). The digestibilities of DM and OM are lower with R2, followed by R4; on the other hand, R1 and R3 showed the best levels of digestibility. The crude protein digestibility value is higher for R1 than for the others. The grounding and pelleting of forage did not improve the intake and digestibility of the rations. Additional studies are needed, especially on the size of ground feed, in order to better elucidate the nutritional value of pelleted fodder.",
"Effect of seasonality of feed resources on dairy cattle production in coastal lowlands of Kenya (Doctoral dissertation, University of Nairobi)",NA,http://hdl.handle.net/11295/90790,,NA," In the Coastal Lowlands of Kenya, small-scale integrated crop-livestock system is the dominant form of agricultural production. Feed quantity and quality are inadequate and rarely meets the nutrient demands of lactating cows especially, in the dry seasons. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of seasonality on availability and quality of feed resources on dairy cattle productivity in Coastal Lowlands of Kenya. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Kwale and Kilifi counties on a random sample of 415 dairy cattle farms followed by a longitudinal survey on a purposive sample of 32 farms from the cross-sectional sample over a period of 12 months. Data from the cross-sectional survey was analyzed for descriptive statistics. Two-Step cluster analysis was used to classify small-scale farmers using variables selected apriori and identified four distinct clusters. The validity and stability of the 4-clusters solution was tested by splitting the sample into two sub-samples according to counties and cluster analyzed separately using the variables selected apriori. Discriminant analysis was done using demographic and socio-economic variables not previously considered in the cluster procedure in order to ascertain the profile of each cluster. The mean herd size was 3.9 of which 30.7% were lactating cows. The mean milk yield/cow/day was 5.7 litres with 44% of farms producing < 5 litres/cow/day. The mean land size was 5.3 acres with 68.4% of households’ having < 6 acres. For the whole sample, 30.4, 28.8, 20.6 and 20.2% of the households were classified into clusters 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Each cluster had unique characteristics which would help define research and development policy priorities based on resource base, opportunities and constraints. xviii The mean CP and NDF of pasture grasses ranged from 84.1 - 97.1 and 603.8 - 724.8 g/kg DM respectively. Leucaena leucocephala had the highest CP of 270.8 g/kg DM. Asystacia gangetica and Commelina benghalensis had a CP content of 131.8 and 162.7 g/kg DM respectively. Napier grass had a CP of 86.4 g/kg DM. Maize stover and green maize forage had CP of 72.2 and 112.8 g/kg DM respectively. The mean CP of maize germ and maize bran was 104.4 and 129.3 g/kg DM with 33.5% and 24.6% utilization respectively. A. gangetica, C. benghalensis, L. leucocephala and maize forage had higher in vitro DM digestibility (IVDMD) (> 50%) compared to maize stover, pastures grasses and napier grass. Pastures grasses IVDMD ranged from 40.3 - 44.7%. In situ rumen DM and CP disappearances were measured at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours of incubation using mobile nylon bag technique. The CP disappearance ranged from 16.81 - 23.54%, 9.91 -17.96%, 20.02%, 9.56%, 13.95% and 20.99% at zero time and 50.64 - 58.47%, 39.11 - 49.46%, 45.78%, 33.49%, 40.25% and 55.22% at 48 hours for weeds, pasture grasses napier grass, maize stover, green maize forage and L. leucocephala respectively. The potential degradability of DM ranged from 60.22 - 72.99% for weeds, 45.52 - 65.8% for pastures, 54.73% for maize stover, 82.24% for green maize forage, 64.16% for napier grass to 74.44% for L. leucocephala. Effective degradability (ED) of DM and CP decreased with increase in outflow rates of 2, 5 and 8% and differed significantly (P < 0.05) between roughages. The ED of DM ranged from 18.68 - 30.13% and 35.48 - 49.23% at outflow rates of k=8 and k=2 for P. maximum and L. leucocephala respectively. At the same outflow rates, the ED of CP ranged from 20.6 - 29.2% and 36.6 - 51.2% for the two. xix Pastures grasses occupied 56.4% (414.5 ha) of land and contributed 55.2% of feed resource. Maize occupied 63.5% of cultivated land and yielded 430.1 mt DM/year of maize stover while napier grass occupied 29.3% and contributed 15.1% of basal feed resource. The estimated annual on-farm feed production and animal requirements was 3,865 and 5,004 mt DM respectively. The annual on-farm feed DM production met cattle requirements during April-June season only. The mean animal live weight change (MLWC) ranged from 168 to 268 g/day for season III (January-March) and season IV (April - June) respectively. The average milk production (AMP) ranged from 4.7 - 5.6 litres/cow/day for season III and season I respectively. Pooling all available feed resources for 12 months through appropriate storage and carry-over between seasons decreased MLWC from 268 to 257 g/day in season IV but increased from 264 to 274, 261 to 278 and 168 to 187 g/day in seasons I, II and III respectively. The AMP followed the same trend as MLWC, decreasing in season IV and increasing in seasons I, II and III. This showed that dairy cattle obtained enough nutrients only in season IV. In conclusion, the crop-livestock production systems in study area were classified into four distinct clusters with distinct production characteristics. Productivity was low within all the clusters and was attributed to poor quality cows and inadequate forage whose availability was seasonal. The available forages were of moderate quality with average to high rumen degradability. There was a deficit in DM availability during the dry season which could be remedied through conserving excess feed during the wet season. These results could be used to develop an integrated forage production and livestock nutrition management plan to provide sufficient year-round feed supply based on animal requirements and supplementation strategies. xx",Thesis
"Effects of dietary supplementation with different concentration of molasses on growth performance, blood metabolites and rumen fermentation indices of Nubian goats",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02636-5,,,Blood metabolites;Goat kids; Growth performance;Molasses;Rumen fermentation,"Molasses is a potential energy supplement; extensively used to improve growth performance, milk and meat characteristics in goats at relatively low concentrations of 5–40% of the diet. Few data are available concerning feeding molasses to goat kids; therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with higher concentrations of molasses on growth performance, blood metabolites and rumen fermentation indices. Twenty male Nubian goat kids (4–6 months old; 9–10 kg BW) were randomly assigned to 4 groups receiving different concentration of molasses: 0% (M-0), 30% (M-30), 40% (M-40) and 45% (M-45) for 5 weeks. Feed (DFI) and water intake (DWI) were measured daily, while the blood and rumen liquor samples were collected weekly.",
Effects of feeding Lantana camara leaf hay on animal performance and health in small east Africa goat breeds,http://dx.doi.org/10.56369/tsaes.3769,,,digestibility; Lantana camara leaf meal; protein supplement; allantoin,"Background: Lantana camara is listed as one of the worst invasive species worldwide and is considered poisonous to livestock. However, in invaded Zimbabwean rangelands, voluntary intake by domestic livestock especially goats of this shrub is common, yet, little is understood about the effect of this browse on animal performance. Objectives: To assess the effects of feeding graded levels of  L. camara (LC) leafy hay on the performance, digestibility, nitrogen balance and microbial protein synthesis in Small East Africa Goat Breeds. Methodology: Eighteen, six to ten months old castrated goats with a mean± (SD) weight of 13.6±4.9 kg were randomly assigned to the six treatment diets in a completely randomised design. Each goat was housed separately in a metabolism cage for the entire experimental period of 21 days.  Lantana camara  leaf hay was incorporated in goat feed as a protein source at 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% inclusion levels.  Commercially bought, goat feed was used as the sixth and control treatment diet. Veld hay was used as a basal diet and water were offered ad-libitum. Results: The average daily dry matter intake was above the minimum recommended of 3% of the animal’s metabolic body weight (kg0.75). Goats fed on 10%LC consumed significantly lower quantities of hay than 5%LC but were not significantly different from goat feed (GF), 15%LC, 20%LC and 25%LC. Apparent digestibility coefficient values ranged from 62% to 71%. Higher nitrogen intakes was observed with diets that were highly palatable such as commercial goat feed and 5% L. camara. Higher microbial protein supply was observed in groups fed diets with high levels of L. camara. Implications: The use of invasive L. camara biomass as a source of goat feed at 5% inclusion is a promising method to control its spread in while addressing the nitrogen deficiencies experienced by livestock that subsist on poor quality feeds in invaded rangelands. Conclusion: Supplementing goats with L. camara leafy hay improves dry matter feed intake and degradability. Contrary to expectations, no negative effects were observed with L. camara leafy meal inclusion in goats diets at 5 to 25 percent inclusion level.",
Effects of moringa and bamboo leaves on groundnut hay utilization by West African Dwarf goats,NA,http://www.lrrd.org/lrrd22/1/asao22012.htm,,"Digestibility, intake, mineral composition, nitrogen balance, nutrients, substitution","The intake, nitrogen utilization, and in vivo nutrient digestibility of Moringa (MOR) and bamboo (BAM) leaves in equal combinations respectively with groundnut hay (50MOR:50GNH; 50BAM:50GNH), with a sole groundnut hay diet (100GNH) as the reference diet, were monitored in 18 West African Dwarf (WAD) goats (9 male and 9 female) with a mean body weight of 9.4 ±0.8 kg, using a randomized complete block design.
No significant (P>0.05) differences were observed in total DM intake values which ranged from  291 to 315 and 316g DM/animal/day, corresponding to 54.6, 59.6 and 59.6 g/kg0.75  for the animals on 100GNH, 50BAM:50GNH and 50MOR:50GNH, respectively. BAM leaf substitution however sinificantly (P<0.05) decreased DM digestibility while a marginal increase was observed with MOR substitution. Both substitutions were observed to significantly (P<0.05) increase CP intake from 39.3 to 44.4 and 56.8 g/d for BAM and MOR substitutions, respectively. MOR substitution significantly (P<0.05) increased diet CP digestibility from 49.9 to 60.2% while BAM substitution marginally increased it to 51.7%. NDF intake was significantly decreased from 131 to 114g/d with MOR leaf substitution while BAM substitution significantly (P<0.05) increased it to 178g/d. A significant (P<0.05) increase in ADF intake was observed with BAM substitution while MOR substitution led to a marginal decrease. A significant (P<0.05) increase in total digestible nutrients was significantly increased from 50.4% to 52.2% with MOR leaf substitution of GNH but a significant (P<0.05) decrease to 46.8% was observed with BAM leaf substitution. All the animals had a positive nitrogen balance with values ranging from 0.71 to 1.50 g/d, which did not differ significantly. Nitrogen retention values as percentages of nitrogen intakes were however significantly (P<0.05) higher for 50MOR:50GNH and 50BAM:50GNH relative to 100GNH. 
The results of this study have shown that GNH as a sole diet can meet the maintenance requirements of WAD goats for nitrogen. However, feeding it along with MOR leaves in the same ratio will significantly improve nitrogen intake and retention, as well as total digestible nutrients. BAM substitution in its own case can only marginally improve nitrogen intake, even though it will exert a significantly positive impact on nitrogen retention. However, it will significantly decrease the total digestible nutrients.",
Effects of supplementing herbaceous forage legume pellets on growth indices and blood profile of West African dwarf sheep fed Guinea grass,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-018-1767-4,,,Animal performance;Blood parameters;Herbaceous legume pellets;Panicum maximum;Rams,"Twenty West African dwarf (WAD) rams with average body weight of 12.43 ± 0.5 kg were used for the experiment that lasted 84 days to investigate the effects of supplementing herbaceous forage legume pellets on weight change and blood profile of animals fed Panicum maximum basal diet. Sole Panicum maximum served as the control diet and three other experimental diets were P. maximum supplemented with Lablab purpureus pellets, P. maximum supplemented with Calopogonium mucunoides pellets and P. maximum supplemented with Mucuna pruriens pellets constituted the four treatments which were arranged in a completely randomised design. The rams were divided into four groups of five animals each and were balanced for variation in live weight before they were assigned the experimental diets. Panicum maximum was offered to the animals ad libitum and legume pellets were supplemented. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed in weight gain of the rams. Those fed the control diet had the lowest value of 41.88 g/day while rams supplemented L. purpureus pellets had the highest value (83.66 g/day). Haematological parameters, leucocyte values and serum biochemical indices of WAD rams were significantly (P < 0.05) different across the dietary treatments at the final stage of the trial. The values for red blood cells, haemoglobin concentration, packed cell volume and mean corpuscular haemoglobin decreased slightly in rams supplemented with M. pruriens pellets. Reduction of serum biochemical parameters was also noticed in rams supplemented with M. pruriens pellets. It can be concluded that L. purpureus pellets ranked the best among the herbaceous legume pellets as supplemental feed for West African dwarf sheep resulting in higher weight gain and better feed conversion efficiency with no deleterious effect on blood profile.

Animals were used in randomized completely block design with three dietary treatments in ten replicates. Treatments were grass hay fed ad libitum to all treatments plus a mixed diet of 48% wheat bran, 15% molasses, 35% cotton seed cake, 1% salt and 1% limestone (T1); 43% wheat bran, 20% sorghum grain, 35% Noug seed cake, 1% salt and 1% limestone (T2) and 47% wheat bran, 16% molasses, 35% sesame seed cake, 1% salt and 1% limestone (T3). Sheep in T3 (1123 g DM/day) consumed more feed (P < 0.001) as compared to sheep in T2 (1077 g DM/day) and T1 (1057 g DM/day). Higher apparent digestibility of DM, OM, CP, NDF and ADF were obtained in T3 groups than in the other treatment groups (P < 0.05). Average daily gain was significantly higher for T3 (158 g/day) than T2 (120 g/day) and T1 (118 g/day) (P < 0.001). Diet 3 was better as compared to the other feeding options.

Growth performance and nutrient digestibility of West African dwarf sheep fed high roughage diet containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae,https://doi.org/10.4314/as.v18i3.5,,,"yeast, ruminant, protein, faeces, fibre","A twelve-week study was conducted to determine the effects of dietary inclusion of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) on growth performance and nutrient digestibility of West African dwarf (WAD) sheep. A total of 12 lambs (6 rams and 6 ewes) were randomly allotted to three treatment diets as follows: treatment I was a high roughage diet with no inclusion of S. cerevisiae; treatment II was a high roughage diet with 0.75 g of S. cerevisiae per kg of diet; treatment III was a high roughage diet with 1.5 g of S. cerevisiae per kg of diet. The chemical composition of the high roughage diet is as follows: dry matter (89.20%), organic matter (85.87%), crude protein (13.21%), crude fibre (16.40%), ether extract (3.30%), ash (4.33%), nitrogen free extract (51.96%), neutral detergent fibre (45.25%) and acid detergent fibre (26.62%). Each group was made up of four replicates with one sheep serving as a replicate. There were significant (p < 0.05) differences among treatments in average daily feed intake (ADFI), and average daily weight gain (ADWG) while final body weight (FBW) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were not significantly (p > 0.05) affected. There were significant (p < 0.05) differences among treatments in dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), crude fibre (CF), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) digestibility coefficients values. Based on these results addition of 1.5 g of S. cerevisiae per kg of diet is recommended.

How to better account for livestock diversity and fodder seasonality in assessing the fodder intake of livestock grazing semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa rangelands,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2018.07.002,,,Fodder intake;Digestibility;Fecal NIRS;Metabolic weight;Pastoralism,"The feeding behavior and fodder intake of cattle, sheep and goats grazing semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa rangelands in Senegal was studied over a one-year cycle. The objective of the study was to improve the assessment of fodder intake by livestock grazing rangelands in semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa. The study was conducted in the service area of a borehole that includes 354 pastoral settlements and a total of 11,000 cattle and 1800 small ruminants. The grazing behavior of five steers was monitored monthly. Their forage intake was estimated every month from hand plucking simulations of all the bites of forage taken by the steers 24 h out of 48. The feces they excreted during the day were collected in fecal bags. Near infrared spectrum (NIRS) images were used to analyze 80 samples of these feces, and the data were then added to an existing reference data set to predict fodder intake and digestibility using NIRS. The complete and contextualized data base was then used to predict the daily fodder intake and its digestibility by cattle, sheep and goats whose fresh feces were systematically and randomly sampled every month in the study area (768 samples). Annual means of the daily dry matter fodder intake were 68.4 ± 6.4 g/kg LW0.75 or 17.2 ± 1.7 g/kg LW for cattle, 73.1 ± 5.3 g/kg LW0.75 or 34.3 ± 2.8 g/kg LW for sheep, and 74.7 ± 8.7 g/kg LW0.75 or 37.1 ± 4.4 g/kg LW for goats. The annual mean organic matter digestibility of grazed fodder was higher for goats (67.4 ± 3.9%) than for sheep (64.1 ± 3.2%) and cattle (59.3 ± 3.8%). The seasonal variations in diet digestibility were bigger for cattle than for sheep, and smaller for goats. The standard reference used to assess livestock fodder intake in tropical Africa relies on a fixed daily intake rate per unit live weight of 25 g/kg LW. Our results show that this method overestimates (+45%) intake by cattle, especially in the dry season, and underestimates intake by small ruminants (–24%). Alternative assessment methods are proposed either relying on a single standard annual intake per metabolic weight unit for all ruminant species, 73 g/kg LW0.75 per day, or on separate annual intake norms per live weight unit for cattle (18 g/kg LW per day) and small ruminants (34 g/kg LW per day). In both cases, modulations (±12%) of the norm are proposed for use in the wet and dry season.",
"Impact of substituted mulberry (Morus alba) leaves with guinea grass (Panicum maximum) on feed intake, milk yield and composition of lactating West African Dwarf does",NA,https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ari/article/view/225939,1597-3115,"Goat, Feed efficiency, Lactating does, Panicum maximum, Morus alba, Milk yield","This study investigated the feed intake, milk yield and milk composition of lactating West African Dwarf (WAD) does fed fresh Panicum maximum which was substituted at five levels (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 %) with fresh mulberry (Morus alba) leaves and concentrate diet was fed alongside the forages. Twenty-five lactating WAD does were used for the experiment for fifty-six days. The does were divided into five groups of five does per group in a completely randomized design and housed in individual pens. Dry matter (DM) intake, milk yield and feed efficiency (FE) for milk production of the goats were measured. There were significant differences (p<0.05) in feed intake, milk yield and FE of the goats. DM intake increased from 612.44 – 676.85 g/day and milk yield from 204.96 to 454.25 g/day with the inclusion of M. alba in the diet. The feed efficiency was 0.33, 0.57, 0.69, 0.74 and 0.48 for 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % M. alba diets respectively. Milk composition was not significantly influenced (p<0.05) by the level of M. alba leaves in the diet. Total solids in milk increased from 16.23 to 17.33 %; protein from 5.94 to 7.36 %; and fat from 4.03 to 4.71 %. In conclusion, supplementation of M. alba leaves in the diet enhanced feed intake and milk production in WAD does.",
Impact of varied time of feeding on the lactation and growth performance of West African Dwarf goat,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-021-02946-2 ,,,Adaptation strategy;Feed efficiency;Feeding regime;Goat milk;Growth performance,"This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of time of feeding on production performance of West African Dwarf (WAD) goats. Two experiments involving twenty-seven goats (15 bucks and 12 gravid does) were conducted. In Experiment I, the bucks were randomly allocated into three treatments of five replicates and fed for 115 days. In experiment II, pregnant goat-does were randomly allocated into three experimental treatments of four replicates per treatment  1 month to kidding. Goats were either fed in the morning (06:00 h), afternoon (12:00 h), or evening (18:00 h) respectively under natural light cycles. In experiment I, dry matter intake, weight gain, carcass characteristic, and meat chemical composition were not affected (P > 0.05) by time of feeding. In experiment II, data collection on feed intake, feed efficiency (FE), and milk yield spanned 6 weeks and were analyzed. From the results, milk yield in morning-fed goat-does was higher than evening-fed does while afternoon-fed does have the lowest yield at P < 0.001. Energy corrected milk in evening-fed does was higher (P = 0.006) than other treatments. Feed efficiency for milk yield and energy corrected milk yield (P < 0.001) in evening-fed does were higher than morning and afternoon-fed does. Milk component yield (g/day) for lactose (P = 0.002) was the highest in morning-fed does; evening-fed does had the highest (P = 0.001) crude fat while afternoon-fed does had the lowest yield for all milk component parameters. Conclusively, feeding in the morning and evening is recommended for milk production and component yield per day. However, for improved energy corrected milk yield and feed efficiency in lactating goats, feeding in the evening is recommended. It is recommended that further studies should be conducted on improving milk productivity in evening-fed goats due to the advantage it had over other feeding regimes. Thus, altering time of feeding could be a suitable alternative feeding strategy in a changing climate with a potential to improve production efficiency, especially in the tropics.",
"Improved region-specific emission factors for enteric methane emissions from cattle in smallholder mixed crop: livestock systems of Nandi County, Kenya",https://doi.org/10.1071/AN17809,,,"Africa, cattle, dry matter digestibility, feed basket, greenhouse gas, liveweight","National greenhouse-gas (GHG) inventories in most developing countries, and in countries in Sub-Saharan Africa in particular, use default (Tier I) GHG emission factors (EFs) provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to estimate enteric methane (CH4) emissions from livestock. Because these EFs are based on data primarily from developed countries, there is a high degree of uncertainty associated with CH4 emission estimates from African livestock systems. Accurate Tier II GHG emission reporting from developing countries becomes particularly important following the Paris Climate agreement made at COP21, which encourages countries to mitigate GHG emissions from agricultural sources. In light of this, the present study provides improved enteric CH4 emission estimates for cattle in Nandi County, Western Kenya, representing a common livestock production system found in East Africa. Using the data from measurements of liveweight and liveweight change, milk production and locomotion collected from 1143 cattle in 127 households across 36 villages over three major agro-ecological zones covering a full year, we estimated total metabolic energy requirements. From this and assessments of digestibility from seasonally available feeds, we estimated feed intake and used this to calculate daily CH4 production by season, and, subsequently, created new EFs. Mean EFs were 50.6, 45.5, 28.5, 33.2 and 29.0 kg CH4/head.year for females (>2 years), males (>2 years), heifers (1–2 years), young males (1–2 years) and calves (<1 year) respectively, and were lower than the IPCC Tier I estimates for unspecified African adult cattle, but higher for calves and young males. Thus, using IPCC Tier 1 EFs may overestimate current enteric CH4 emissions in some African livestock systems.",
In vivo digestibility of six selected fodder species by goats in northern Ghana,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-019-01989-w,,,Browse species;Digestibility;Supplementation;West African Dwarf goats,"An in vivo digestibility trial was conducted to evaluate the digestibility of six forages. These were selected indigenous browse species and groundnut haulms in Lawra and Jirapa Districts of the Upper West Region of Ghana. Groundnut haulms served as a control due to its known good digestibility in small ruminants. Thirty West African Dwarf (WAD) young castrated billy goats with a mean age of 8 months were used. The average live body weight was 8.9 ± 0.1 kg. The animals were randomly assigned to the six treatments and replicated five times in a completely randomized design. They were confined in metabolism cages. The adaptation period was 3 weeks after which data was taken for 10 days. The treatments were the leaves and tiny twigs of T1 Annona senegalensis, T2 Ficus gnaphalocarpa, T3 Pericopsis laxiflora, T4 Pterocarpus erinaceus, T5 Afzelia africana, and T6 (control) Arachis hypogaea. Feed intake, faecal matter and urine output were measured. The results indicated that dry matter (DM) contents of the feedstuffs were less than 50% but crude protein (CP) contents were higher than the minimum required for sustaining ruminants. Neutral and acid detergent fibre contents were high, and F. gnaphalocarpa, in particular, contained a higher level of phosphorus (P). The amounts of feed intakes were typical of most fodder species with the exception of P. laxiflora and P. erinaceus, which were lower (P < 0.05). The apparent digestibility values were also typical of most fodder species but the digestibility of A. africana fibre appeared to be lower. Nitrogen retention was positive for all test species with the exception of P. laxiflora, which was negative. Mortality was recorded in animals on P. laxiflora, and the rate was high. Pericopsis laxiflora leaves, even though morphologically similar to the leaves of P. erinaceus, were not a suitable fodder. Ficus gnaphalocarpa appeared to be the overall best fodder species in terms of nutrient uptake.",

Inclusion of Tithonia diversifolia in multinutrient blocks for WestAfrican dwarf goats fed Brachiaria straw,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-014-0597-2,,,Brachiaria ruziziensis;Tithonia diversifolia;Multinutrient blocks;West African dwarf goat;In vivo digestibility,"Recent investigations suggest that the development of multinutrient feed blocks with inclusion of tree and shrub leaves could improve the nutritive value and digestibility of straw. In order to test these possibilities, three types of multinutrient blocks (MNB) namely: MNB0 (wheat bran = 100 %; Tithonia diversifolia leaf = 0 %), MNB50 (wheat bran = 50 %; T. diversifolia leaf = 50 %) and MNB100 (wheat bran = 0 %; T. diversifolia leaf = 100 %) were fed for 15 days in a 3 × 3 Latin square arrangement to West African dwarf goats consuming Brachiaria ruziziensis straw. The blocks presented a good cohesion and a good hardness. The inclusion of T. diversifolia improved levels of crude protein, mineral, feed unit for milk production (UFL) and feed unit for meat production (UFV), but decreased palatability. The effects on the digestibility of B. ruziziensis straw were evaluated in nine West African dwarf goats fed individually with MNB0 + straw, MNB50 + straw and MNB100 + straw. The dry matter, organic matter and crude fibre digestibility of B. ruziziensis straw increased slightly with increasing level of inclusion of T. diversifolia. The apparent digestibility of nitrogen was comparable for all diets independent of the level of inclusion of T. diversifolia. This study showed that the inclusion of T. diversifolia leaves in the MNBs can be recommended to improve the feeding of goats during periods of drought.",

Nutritional potential of bamboo leaves for feeding dairy cattle,https://doi.org/10.1590/1983-40632019v4954370,,,Fodder; in vivo digestibility; woody grass,"Feed shortage during the dry season in the highlands of Madagascar negatively impacts the dairy cattle productivity, as well as the farmers’ income. Bamboo can produce a high quantity of biomass and could be an alternative way to increase the fodder supply for cattle. The present study aimed to assess the compositional information and the optimal rate of bamboo as fodder for dairy cattle. Leaf samples from nine bamboo species were collected to determine their chemical composition and nutritive value. A feeding experiment was also conducted using ten dairy cows, over ten weeks. Bamboo leaves were mixed with maize silage in five proportions: SIL0:BAM100, SIL25:BAM75, SIL50:BAM50, SIL75:BAM25 and SIL100:BAM0. The contents of dry matter, total ash and crude protein in the bamboo leaves were, respectively, 44.5-64.6 %, 6.68-18.5 % and 7.71-15.4 %. In the feeding trial, the dry matter intake of bamboo leaves was 1.6-7.1 kg per day, with an average of 4.8 kg per day. The dry matter apparent digestibility of bamboo leaves was 37.4-56.4 %. The milk production reached 13.6-14.4 L per cow, per day, but there was no significant difference concerning the rate of bamboo leaves in the mixed diet (p > 0.05). The introduction of bamboo leaves into the ruminants diet did not affect their milk production.

However, little is known about the feeding preferences of sheep and the digestibility of such native tree/shrub fodder. Such knowledge could improve their use on smallholder farms. Multiple-choice feeding preference tests were conducted on six tree fodders (Annona senegalensis, Blighia sapida, Cassia sieberiana, Gmelina arborea, Khaya senegalensis, and Mangifera indica) to determine the best choice to feed the local rams and ewe Djallonke sheep. The cafeteria test involved four rams and four ewes. In addition, an in vivo trial using metabolic cages was conducted to evaluate the voluntary intake of dried woody leaves and the dry matter digestibility of diets containing these dried leaves. Preferences varied significantly (p ≤ 0.05) according to the woody species. Based on relative intake values, sheep preferred, in decreasing order, the leaves of M. indica, B. sapida, K. senegalensis, G. arborea, A. senegalensis, and C. sieberiana. The apparent digestibility of dry matter was highest (p ≤ 0.01) in the G. arborea diet (86.8%); all diets presented a value higher than 70%. This study provided helpful information about better resource utilization to improve animal productivity.

Prediction of dry matter intake and gross feed efficiency using milk production and live weight in first-parity Holstein cows,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-022-03275-8,,,Correlation;Easy-to-measure traits;Feed intake;Feed efficiency;Stepwise regression,"Direct measurement of dry matter intake (DMI) presents a major challenge in estimating gross feed efficiency (GFE) in dairy cattle. This challenge can, however, be resolved through the prediction of DMI and GFE from easy-to-measure traits such as milk production (i.e. milk yield, energy-corrected milk (ECM), butterfat, protein, lactose) and live weight (LW). The main objective of this study was, therefore, to investigate the feasibility of predicting dry matter intake and gross feed efficiency for first-parity Holstein cows using milk production traits and LW. Data comprised of 30 daily measurements of DMI and milk production traits, and 25 daily LW records of a group of 100 first-parity Holstein cows, fed a total mixed ration. Gross feed efficiency was calculated as kg ECM divided by kg DMI. The initial step was to estimate correlations of milk production traits and LW with DMI and GFE, to identify the best potential predictors of DMI and GFE. Subsequently, a forward stepwise regression analysis was used to develop models to predict DMI and GFE from LW and milk production traits, followed by within-herd validations. Means for DMI, butterfat yield (BFY) and LW were 21.91 ± 2.77 kg/day, 0.95 ± 0.14 kg/day and 572 ± 15.58 kg/day, respectively. Mean GFE was 1.32 ± 0.22. Dry matter intake had positive correlations with milk yield (MY) (r = 0.32, p < 0.001) and LW (r = 0.76, p < 0.0001) and an antagonistic association with butterfat percent (BFP) (r =  − 0.55, p < 0.001). On the other hand, GFE was positively associated with MY (r = 0.36, p < 0.001), BFP (r = 0.53, p < 0.001) and BFY (r = 0.83, p < 0.0001), and negatively correlated with LW (r =  − 0.23, p > 0.05). Dry matter intake was predicted reliably by a model comprising of only LW and MY (R2 = 0.79; root mean squared error (RMSE) = 1.05 kg/day). A model that included BFY, MY and LW had the highest ability to predict GFE (R2 = 0.98; RMSE = 0.05). Live weight and BFY were the main predictor traits for DMI and GFE, respectively. The best models for predicting DMI and GFE were as follows: DMI (kg/day) =  − 54.21 − 0.192 × MY (kg/day) + 0.146 × LW (kg/day) and GFE (kg/day) = 4.120 + 0.024 × MY (kg/day) + 1.000 × BFY (kg/day) − 0.008 × LW (kg/day). Thus, daily DMI (kg/day) and GFE can be reliably predicted from LW and milk production traits using these developed models in first-parity Holstein cows. This presents a big promise to generate large quantities of data of individual cow DMI and GFE, which can be used to implement genetic improvement of feed efficiency.",
Reproductive and Lactation Characteristics of West African Dwarf Goats Offered Moringa oleifera Herbage Supplement,NA,,,lactation characteristics;Moringa oleifera herbage supplement;reproduction;West African Dwarf goats,"Humans have identified milk (product from female mammary gland) as a major source of protein and have recommended it for all ages. Humans have relied heavily on livestock, especially ruminants for intake. Among these ruminants, milk from cattle has been most used and researched into. Small ruminants (sheep and goat) also produce milk and are of growing interest recently. Among goats, the Saanen breed has been the “New Jersey” with about 3 liters of milk yield daily (Gőkdai et al. 2020). West African Dwarf goat is the predominant breed in Southern Nigeria. It produces a low quantity of milk when compared with other goat breeds (Devendra and Burns, 1983; Adebambo et al. 1994; Ojoawo and Akinsoyinu, 2014). Valerie (1996) reported that West African Dwarf (WAD) goats produce low milk when compared with other nonseasonal breeds with milk yield of 0.3 kg/day and had contributed to the low growth rate in the offsprings. However, it had been observed that remarkable improvement can be achieved under improved nutrition and management conditions (Milerski and Mares, 2001). Nutrition plays a major role in milk quantity and quality. One of the identified ways of assessing milk yield has been to assess the nutrition of the dairy ruminants (Milerski and Mares, 2001). This has usually been done with concentrate diets. However, ruminants depend on forage for survival (Banerjee, 2013). The response of ruminants in terms of performance and reproductive characteristics is being assessed using multipurpose trees. One of such trees of global interest is Moringa oleifera. Moringa oleifera leaf meal has been reported to increase feed intake, nutrient digestibility, reduced worm load, replaced conventional mixed concentrate and did not pose a health threat when included in diets of growing goats and sheep (Sultana et al. 2015; Yusuf et al. 2016; Zaher et al. 2020). Therefore, there is a need to assess the response of these goats to Moringa oleifera herbage supplementation before and after kidding; during lactation, and its ",

Nine Pelibuey sheep, 32.6 ± 5.33 kg live weight (LW), fitted with rumen cannula were used. A complete randomized block design was employed. Two experimental periods of 60 days each, with 60-day intervals between them, were used. Experimental treatments were as follows (n = 6): T1 (control), 100 % Pennisetum purpureum grass; T2, 20 % L. leucocephala + 80 % P. purpureum; T3, 40 % L. leucocephala + 60 % P. purpureum. In situ rumen neutral detergent fiber (aNDF) and crude protein (CP) degradation, dry matter intake (DMI), volatile fatty acids (VFA) production, estimated methane (CH4) yield, rumen pH, ammonia nitrogen (N-NH3), and protozoa counts were measured. The aNDF in situ rumen degradation of P. purpureum and leucaena was higher (P < 0.05) in T2 and T3. Leucaena CP degradation was higher in T2 and T3 but for P. purpureum it was only significantly higher in T3. Leucaena aNDF and CP degradation rate (c) was 50 % higher (P < 0.05) in T2 and T3, but only higher in T3 for P. purpureum. Voluntary intake and rumen (N-NH3) was higher in T2 and T3 (P = 0.0001, P = 0.005, respectively). Molar VFA proportions were similar for all treatments (P > 0.05). Protozoa counts and in vitro gas production (48 h) were lower in T2 and T3 (P < 0.05, P < 0.0001). Estimated methane yield (mol CH4/day) was higher in sheep fed leucaena (P < 0.0001). However, CH4 yield relative to animal performance (mol CH4/g LW gain) was lower in T2 and T3 (P < 0.0001). In summary, these results indicate that including L. leucocephala in sheep diets did not modify rumen fermentation pattern (same VFA ratios) nor reduce the amount of CH4 per unit of DMI (mol CH4/g DMI). However, leucaena inclusion does increase rumen N-NH3, aNDF and CP digestibility, and voluntary intake.",
Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) vine silage: a cost-effective supplement for milk production in smallholder dairy-farming systems of East Africa?,https://doi.org/10.1071/AN18743,,,"economic, evaluation, feed preservation, non-conventional feed, rain-fed system, tropical agriculture","Context: Dairy production in East Africa is dominated by smallholder production systems, but is dogged by suboptimal milk production mediated by poor nutrition. Grain-based concentrates can be used to make the energy and protein deficits in rain-fed systems, but this strategy faces several hurdles. For livestock production systems to be sustainable, it is important that less human-edible food is fed to animals and sweet potato can serve both as a source of human food (tuber) and animal feed (vines). Smallholder scale-appropriate technology has been used to allow feed preservation of the perishable sweet potato vines for use throughout the year.

Aims: We assessed the efficacy of sweet potato vine silage plus wheat bran (SPVSWB) as a supplement to maintain milk production at a lower cost than that of grain-based commercial dairy concentrate (CDC).

Methods: Multiparous Holstein–Friesian cattle (n = 12) were given a basal diet of Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum cv. South Africa), ad libitum, plus a fixed amount of either SPVSWB or CDC, (designed to be both iso-nitrogenous and iso-caloric) during late (LL) and early (EL) lactations.

Key results: Daily milk yield was lower for SPVSWB than for CDC groups, although comparable (not significant), in both LL (6.2 vs 7.5 L/day) and EL (14.2 vs 16.0 L/day); however, the lower cost of production for SPVSWB (23.2 vs 48.7 KES/kg DM) ensured that margins on milk income over feed (per cow per day) were greater for SPVSWB in both periods. (LL: 71 vs 14.5; and EL: 426 vs 400 KES/day). The lower intake for SPVSWB than for CDC is most probably due to high neutral detergent fibre content in the supplement and the lower milk production, owing to either, or both, of lower energy and protein intake.

Conclusions: It is suggested that some reformulation of SPVS, replacing in part or in whole the Napier grass with rejected sweet potato tubers, will decrease the neutral detergent fibre content, increase the metabolisable energy content, reducing the need for additional wheat bran and may, thereby, enhance the production response to equate with that of CDC.

Implications: It is clear that, despite SPVSWB eliciting lower milk production (LL 6.2 and EL14.2 L/day) than does CDC (LL 7.5 and EL 16.0 L/day), SPVSWB is a cost-effective, accessible alternative to grain-based supplementation in small-holder dairy-farming systems of Kenya.",
The ability of tanniniferous legumes to reduce methane production and enhance feed utilization in Barki rams: in vitro and in vivo evaluation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2020.106259,,,Barki rams;Berseem hay;Methane emission;Ruminal fermentation;Tanniniferous plants,"Two experiments (in vitro and in vivo evaluation) were conducted to evaluate the ability of three different tanniniferous legumes to replace berseem hay on ruminal fermentation, digestibility and methane (CH4) emission. Berseem (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) hay (BH) was considered as control, or replaced at 50 % with Acacia saligna (AS), Leucaena leucocephala (LL) or Atriplex halimus (AH) on a DM basis. In Experiment 1 (in vitro evaluation), in vitro ruminal degradability, gas and CH4 production were measured. In Experiment 2 (in vivo evaluation), twelve Barki rams weighing 43.29 ± 0.13 kg were randomly assigned into 4 treatments and individually fed the BH, AS and LL diets for 30 days (21 days for adaptation, 7 days for digestibility and N balance and the subsequent 2 days for CH4 measurements). Results of Experiment 1 showed that AS, LL and AH diets decreased (P < 0.05) gas, CH4 and total protozoa compared to BH. Both AS and LL diets increased (P < 0.05) ruminal propionate and partitioning factor, while decreased, ammonia-N (NH3-N) concentrations, acetate, acetate/propionate ratio and protozoa count compared to the BH diet. In Experiment 2, the LL diet decreased (P < 0.05) dry matter intake and digestibility of crude protein compared with the BH diet. Rams fed both AS and LL diets showed greater (P < 0.05) fecal N and retained N, while decreased (P < 0.01) urinary N excretion and exhibited 11.45 % reductions in CH4 production. In conclusion, the partial replacement of BH with AS reduced N losses and CH4 emissions without negative effects on ruminal fermentation.",
The effects of Brachiaria grass cultivars on lactation performance of dairy cattle in Kenya,NA,,,NA,"Brachiaria grass is a high quality tropical grass native to East and Central Africa. It is widely grown for grazing, hay and silage making in South America, Australia and East Asia. An on-farm feeding trial was carried out in Kangundo sub County in Machakos County in mid-altitude eastern region of Kenya to evaluate the effects of feeding Brachiaria cultivars on milk yield. Twelve farmers fed cows on either Brachiaria brizantha cvs. Piata, Xaraes and MG4 or B. decumbens cv. Basilisk. A total of 12 dairy cows in mid lactation (between 3 and 6 months into lactation) were used. Milk yield increased by 15-40% in cows fed Brachiaria grasses compared to local feeds which were varied mixtures of Napier grass, maize stover and natural pastures. A second study was conducted at KALRO Mtwapa in coastal lowlands to evaluate the effect of Mulato II, Piata and Xaraes on milk production. Sixteen (16) Jersey cows in mid to late lactation were grouped into four and fed on either Mulato II, Piata, Xaraes or Bana as the control. There were no differences (P>0.05) between the daily grass dry matter intake which ranged from 5.7 to 6.4 kg/cow. Daily milk yield was similar between cows fed Bana (4.6 kg/cow) and Piata (4.7 kg/cow). However, cows fed on either Mulato II or Xaraes produced less (P<0.05) milk (4.4 and 3.6 kg/cow respectively) than cows fed Bana (4.6 kg/cow). The study concluded that; compared to local feeds in Kangundo sub County, Brachiaria increased milk by 15-40%. It also has potential to compliment Napier grass in dairy feeding in coastal Kenya. Farmers should be encouraged to grow more Brachiaria for increased milk production.",Conference paper
Use of Prosopis juliflora seedpod as livestock feed supplement in the arid and semi-arid rangelands of Kenya,NA,,,NA,"Trees and shrubs have provided many benefits. Currently these are disappearing in the arid and semi-arid areas of Kenya and affecting the livelihoods of pastoralist depending on livestock production. The climate change will affect it further. The trees and shrubs are under serious threat, especially in the Sahelian zone, owing to increased periodic droughts, rapid increase of population leading to overexploitation. The aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of incorporating Prosopis juliflora seedpods into a typical dryland livestock production system. Twenty weaner Galla goats of similar age (6 months) and weights (11–14 kg) were randomly assigned to four treatments of five weaners each. The treatments were PJP0- No P. juliflora (control treatment), PJP100- (100 g/goat/day P. juliflora), PJP200 (200 g/goat/day P. juliflora), and PJP400 (400 g/goat/day P. juliflora). The experiment lasted for 70 days. All the treatment groups exhibited higher average weekly weight gains than PJP0 (control) throughout the experimental period. However, for the first 3 weeks, these differences were not statistically significant (P < 0.05). From the fifth week onwards, however, the differences in growth rates were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Treatment PJP200 exhibited the highest total weight gain (3.96 kg), followed by PJP400 (2.70 kg). Group PJP0 had lowest weight by the end of the experiment. This study demonstrated that P. juliflora could be used as goats feed up to 200 g/goat/day giving good weight gains and no negative effects on feed intakes and digestibility.",Book
